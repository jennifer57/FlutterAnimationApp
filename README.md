# FlutterAnimationsApp

### Setup

#### Flutter
To get the app running, Flutter must be installed. We have tested the app with latest stable release of the Flutter SDK: 2.2.3.
Run the following command to see if there are any dependencies you need to install to complete the setup: 

`flutter doctor`

#### Dependencies

Since we have a few dependencies in the app, they need to be installed via the user interface or via terminal with the following command:

`flutter pub get`

### Demo

Demo of the app can be downloaded here.
