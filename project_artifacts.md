# User Stories 

For this project it was difficult to formulate exact user stories or create wireframes, as our goal was to test animations in Flutter. 
Our goal was to implement simple as well as complex animations and see how well this could be implemented. 

Nevertheless, we formulated a few user stories at the beginning of the semester: 

1. Setting up the project.
2. The app displays the overview screen at startup.
3. The app displays a custom menu including animations.
4. The app shows a description of how the custom menu was implemented.
5. The app shows basic animations in Flutter. 
6. The app shows descriptions for the basic animations in Flutter.
7. The app shows Advanced Animations in Flutter.
8. The app shows descriptions for Advanced Animations in Flutter.

After reading up on Flutter as well as Flutter's animations, we defined simple and more difficult animations in more detail and set out to try out and thus implement the following animations: 

- Build-in implicit animation
- TweenAnimation
- Build-in explicit animation
- AnimatedBuilder
- Animation with Rive
